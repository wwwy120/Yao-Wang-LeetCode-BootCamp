# Week 2: Strings, Hash Maps

## Approach
* Hash Map Pattern
    * Definition: Stores key-value pairs, enabling fast data retrieval by directly accessing values through unique keys
    * Use Cases:
        * Fast data access and retrieval
        * Storing relationships between pairs of data
        * Implementing dictionaries, database indexing, caches
    * Advantages:
        * Efficient Data Access: O(1) time complexity of lookup, insert, and delete operations on average.
        * Flexibility in key Usage: Unlike arrays, keys in hash maps can be of various data types
        * Avoid data duplicates
    * When to use:
        * Need fast access to data, and
        * Data is relational, requiring key-value pairs
